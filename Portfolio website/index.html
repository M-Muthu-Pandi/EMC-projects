    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am Muthupandi, based in Chennai, Tamilnadu, with a background in both commerce and technology. I completed my
        schooling at St. Paul's Higher Secondary School and earned my Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) degree
        from St. Thomas College of Arts and Science.

        I have 2 years and 6 months of experience working as a Store Executive at Royal Enfield headquarters, where I
        developed skills in inventory management, logistics, and team collaboration.

        Driven by my passion for technology, I transitioned to the IT field by completing a Full Stack Developer course
        with certification from Error Makes Clever. I am now seeking opportunities in IT where I can leverage my new skills
        in full stack development to contribute to innovative projects and grow professionally in a dynamic environment.
